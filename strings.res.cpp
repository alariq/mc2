	"Colonel Renard has ordered the commencement of operations against House Liao.  \n\nDrop into the Liao-controlled Darian Sector. Highest priority is the capture of the Prison Complex and rescue of a Steiner operative held there. Other priority targets are the Fuel Tank reserves, Weapons Facility, and Repair Bay in this sector.\n\nSteiner Crypto reports that the Mobile HQ captured in the Carroll Sector contains log files showing that Liao has been funding the Bandits with weapons and C-bills. Supplying Steiner enemies with military equipment is an act of aggression, and Steiner High Command has ordered active defensive measures against House Liao.\n\nTactical Officer Notes:  \nThings are getting hot on Carver V, Commander. We're not taking on some local gangs this time; we're attacking one of the major Houses of the Inner Sphere. I hope you know what you're doing.\n\nBe careful around the Fuel Tanks; an explosion can destroy even Heavy 'Mechs. Take medium- or long-range 'Mechs and fire on those tanks from a distance. I've seen other commanders purposely ignite Fuel Tanks from long range to cripple nearby enemies.\n\nLiao typically fields fast, maneuverable units and has the best electronics and sensor gear available. All that speed has a price, though: Liao 'Mechs are lightly armored.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Show them that the noble Houses are not invincible, and they will rise up.\n\nBaxter\n\nTactical Officer Notes: \nSir, might I remind you that the palace is one of the most heavily fortified areas on the entire planet.

They have confirmed that the partisans are massing to attack the facility and should provide a significant distraction for your own mission.\n\nHonor and Xin Sheng.\n\nTactical Officer Notes:  \nThe Legion sounds dangerous, Commander. Don't take them lightly. At that size, they'll be able to destroy most 'Mechs in a straight firefight. The Steiner facilities on Carver V aren't known for their engineering, so I'm surprised they could design such a powerful unit.\n\nLiao Intel tells us that their operative is still in the area but laying low. It may be worthwhile to meet with him and get any information we can.\n\nRecon has pointed out some interesting strategic areas. The production facility is located in a low valley surrounded by mountains, which allows us to take the high ground. Thick woods in the area provide a perfect setup to use indirect-fire weapons such as LRMs and Fixed Artillery.\n\nIn addition, the Mandrissa is offering bonus C-bills if we can also destroy some other factories and a generator to guarantee that Steiner won't build another Legion facility.\n\n",

Cho is one of the strongest Liao positions on Carver V and their primary reinforcement point. We need you to hit this area and take out as many 'Mechs and vehicles as possible before they combine with Steiner troops. I've also listed some secondary targets that will weaken Liao's capacity to mount an offense.\n\nI hope you can pull this off, Commander. The hopes of the people go with you.\n\nBaxter\n\nTactical Officer Notes:  \nI've got copies of what few maps there are of the area; I guess Liao didn't want anyone snooping around. Mt. Cho is big, and the obvious approaches are heavily defended. I'd scout around a bit; someplace that large must have a weakness.\n\nThe good news is that we might not have to go to the mountain at all. Liao isn't expecting any sort of attack here; most of their units are positioned outside the mountain.",

After several days of orbital bombardment and aerospace fighter strikes, the base's walls have been shattered, leaving it virtually defenseless.

Capable of jumping out of range of short-range weapons or returning close volleys with laser blasts, few 'Mechs match the Catapult's deadly stalking prowess.\n\nWhen left alone too long, even against much smaller opponents, the Catapult's lack of defensive capabilities can become all too apparent.\n\n\n",

	"Commander:\n\nThe Mandrissa has favored you with a mission of the highest importance.\n\nOur success in this conflict has depleted Steiner and Davion reserves.  Reinforcements from the Inner Sphere, however, will quickly change the situation. The Mandrissa requires all transmissions from Carver V to be halted until the time is appropriate.\n\nTravel to Carver V's moon base, guarded by Davion forces. The HPG Transmitters located there are the only means of communication to the rest of the Inner Sphere. Render both transmitters inoperable, and destroy the Davion Dropship stationed there so Major Kelly does not recapture the moon base.\n\nAs an incentive for this dangerous undertaking, the Mandrissa gives you ownership of all the Davion Weapons Facilities located there.  \n\nTactical Officer Notes: \nCommander, operating on Carver V's moon means we won't be able to rely on any support. Don't plan on being able to fly in Repair Trucks, Salvage Craft, or any of our support options. We only have what we bring.\n\nThis moon base holds Davion's main weapons storage facility as well as the HPG Station. That means it's going to be guarded with some heavy firepower. Expect the best stationary defense that Davion has: Gauss Rifle Turrets.\n\nTheir Intel also reports the presence of Clanners, probably Bondsmen serving under the Davion banner. Don't underestimate the Clanners: They're born and bred for 'Mech combat.\n\n\n",

If they can be captured, Gauss Turrets offer a great strategic advantage to the MechCommander with large territories under control.\n\nA group of Gauss Turrets depends on a Turret Generator and a Turret Control to function.

It has been weakened, but our Recon reports reinforcements en route to bolster its weakening defenses.\n\nYou must intercept and destroy these reinforcements; otherwise, Davion will be impossible to dislodge from this sector.\n\nHonor and Xin Sheng.\n\nTactical Officer Notes: \nLiao Recon and Intel are excellent on this mission as usual, Commander. Based on the images, we can expect some Medium and Light Davion 'Mechs with a large number of tank escorts. Be careful if you spot any Shadow Cats: They're fast, armed with a Gauss Rifle, and fitted with jump jets.  \n\nThe bases, on the other hand, are mainly protected by just their LRM and Autocannon Turrets.

Acquisition of these buildings are secondary objectives.\n\nTactical Officer Notes:  \nLooks like Renard's actions against Liao have sparked a powder keg. Liao and Steiner are openly attacking each other and we've got mission assignments all over Carver V.\n\nThe commander of this base overextended his forces falling for a feint executed by Bandit skirmishers. He's lost the Sensor Tower network and Turret Control protecting the northern section of a major road. Taking these back would give us an edge.\n\nWe need at least one fast 'Mech to capture those control buildings. But we'll also need some power to defend them afterwards; otherwise, Liao forces will just recapture the buildings.\n\nIn a major offensive like this, expect to see some Raven BattleMechs.

	"Commander, we've got a situation in the city of Bannikburg. A combined force of Steiner and Liao 'Mechs attacked the city at dawn yesterday and succeeded in taking control of most of the terrain north of the river. \n\nWe need to destroy the incoming Steiner and Liao units before they tear down the city. I've also listed important secondary objectives that we need recaptured.\n\nI can't stress the importance of Bannikburg enough. It's the largest city for several hundred miles and our primary resupply point. If Bannikburg falls, we could lose every sector in the region.\n\nBaxter\n\nTactical Officer Notes:  \nWell, it looks like Steiner and Liao have finalized their treaty. This should be a tough engagement: Steiner's got heavy armor; Liao's got speed and stealth. Luckily, we have access to Davion's supply of Clan equipment. Clan 'Mechs and weapons are the cutting edge of technology; you won't find better.\n\nI imagine Steiner will come straight up the middle; they've got the armor for that. Liao, though, as we've learned, prefers the indirect approach. Keep an eye on your flanks, just in case they manage to sneak some units across the river.\n\nBaxter sent some maps along, and he wasn't kidding about Bannikburg being a resupply point. There's Resource Buildings all over the place and a couple of Repair Bays. Grab everything you can, because we'll need it.",
